## System Description

The system is comprised of a Java Spring Boot backend and a React.js frontend, following a client-server architecture. It enables users to reserve and manage wireless numbers efficiently, including associating ICCID with MSISDN and IMEI when allocating to customers.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Java 11, Spring Boot 2.7.13
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Database:** MySQL (or specify your preferred database technology)

## Functional Requirements

The system includes functionalities like:
- Reserving ICCID, MSISDN, and IMEI numbers.
- Associating ICCID with MSISDN and IMEI during allocation.
- Tracking reservation dates and number availability.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The system is optimized for responsiveness, ensuring minimal latency.
- **Security:** Stringent security measures are in place, including JWT-based authentication and data encryption.
- **User Interface:** The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.
- **Database:** The chosen database technology ensures data security and efficiency.
- **Compatibility:** The frontend is designed for cross-browser compatibility.

## Security

### Authentication and Authorization

The system employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. It includes JWT-based authentication, user credentials, token expiry, role-based access control (RBAC), authorization claims, and resource protection.

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is transmitted over secure, encrypted connections using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protocols. End-to-end encryption ensures that unauthorized access is nearly impossible.

## User Interface Design

The user interface focuses on simplicity and user-friendliness, featuring simple forms for number reservation and an intuitive layout for tracking reservations.

## Database

The system stores data securely in a MySQL database (or specify your preferred database technology).

## API Specification

The system defines RESTful API endpoints for reserving numbers, associating them, and checking availability.

## Testing

A comprehensive testing strategy includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

## Deployment

Deployment instructions will guide the deployment of the backend and frontend components in a production environment.
